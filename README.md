**Bayesian model comparison using the Hyv채rinen score**.  
*\[more details in Shao, Jacob, Ding, Tarokh (2017) at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00136](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00136)\]*

This package provides functions that compute the **Hyv채rinen score** (and the log-evidence as an aside) of a Bayesian model. This is achieved by using either **SMC** \[e.g. [Chopin (2002)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/89/3/539/251804) and [Del Moral, Doucet, Jasra (2006)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2006.00553.x/abstract)\] or **SMC<sup>2</sup>** \[cf. [Chopin, Jacob, Papaspiliopoulos (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2012.01046.x/abstract)\], depending on whether the likelihood can be evaluated.

### <a name="howto_hscore"></a> Computing the Hyv채rinen score

After installing and loading the package, computing the Hyv채rinen score of a model is done by calling
```R
hscore(observations, model, algorithmic_parameters)
```
where the inputs consist of
* `observations`: sequence of dimY-dimensional observations Y<sub>1</sub> , ... , Y<sub>T</sub> encoded as a dimY by T `matrix`
* `model`: Bayesian model encoded as a `list` (see [Defining a model](#howto_model))
* `algorithmic_parameters` : algorithmic parameters provided as a `list` (see [Setting algorithmic parameters](#howto_algoparam))

The function `hscore` is a wrapper that either calls `smc(observations, model, algorithmic_parameters)` or `smc2(observations, model, algorithmic_parameters)` depending on whether the `model` specifies the likelihood or not.  
The output is detailed below (see [Output description](#output)).

### <a name="output"></a> Output description
The output of `hscore`, `smc`, or `smc2` is a `list`. Depending on the specified `algorithmic_parameters`, some of its fields may be set to `NULL`. In its most exhaustive form, the outputs will contain the following objects:
* `thetas` = last set of particles thetas (dimtheta by Ntheta `matrix`)
* `normw` = corresponding normalized weights (`vector` of length Ntheta)
* `byproducts` or `PFs` = corresponding `list` of byproducts (e.g. particle filters in the case of `smc2`)
* `logtargetdensities` = corresponding evaluations of target log-densities (`vector` of length Ntheta)
* `thetas_history` = `list` of all successive sets of particles thetas (one `matrix` per timestep, starting with the prior, so the length of the `list` is T+1)
* `normw_history` = `list` of corresponding normalized weights (i.e. `list` of `vector`)
* `logtargetdensities_history` = `list` of corresponding target log-densities evaluations (i.e. `list` of `vector`)
* `byproducts_history` of `PF_history` = `list` of corresponding byproducts or particle filters (i.e. `list` of `list`)
* `logevidence` = cumulative logevidence (`vector` of length T)
* `hscore` = cumulative H-score using Fisher/Louis type identities (`vector` of length T)
* `hscoreDDE` = cumulative H-score using kernel density estimation (`vector` of length T)
* `ESS` = successive ESS (`vector` of length T)
* `rejuvenation_times` = successive times when rejuvenation occured (`vector` of random length less than T)
* `rejuvenation_rate` = associated acceptance rates (`vector` of random length less than T)
* `method` = method called (`string` equal to 'SMC' or 'SMC2')
* `algorithmic_parameters` = `list` of algorithmic parameters used
